cool live coding environment
editor
kreck evaluation
debugger
canvas


vim-like editor
  codemirror looks cool but it's also bloat
    is it really?
      It's bigger than templeOS

todo
  cursor centering
  relative gutters
  modes

cursor position
  line & char
scroller position

char matrix?
lines

line numbers
  text floats right

it doesn't have to be polished up
it should be useful

no line elements?

inner text of div with bold, font, etc.

what happens to inner text when I edit it and it's distributed over many elements?

how inner text gets determined

why min-width = 0 fixes it?

making the editor border highlighted when contents are edited
  1
    what?
      whole editor contenteditable
      elements that shouldn't be editable, have it disabled
    something borke!
      ed-text divs get added when inserting newlines
        suppress insertParagraph input events?
  2
    what?
      do it with events

createrange

"pre" white space

contenteditable in cm

pasting with formatting bug?

more visible cursor

describe this whole selector:
.ed-text {
  overflow-x: auto;
  white-space: nowrap;
  flex-grow: 1;
}

paragraph insert event


identifying stuff to highlight
  where to insert tags?
    dumb hack
      how
        insert something like <nonce> </nonce> into innerText
        find it in innerHtml
        replace it with appropriate tags
      why dumb?
    but for coloring parens, you can just walk over html

centering cursor
  with scroller
    editing scroller position

events with editable content
  input
  no select

weird updates
  text, html, dom


fixed number of lines updated from buffer?
  problem with selection

undo, redo?
  textarea

roles
  do roles actually do anything?
  textbox

  
reversing cm


one leading <br> in div seems to not do anything
but two do

css selectors
  z-index
    elements with higher z-index are on top
  overflow-x
  align-items
  line-height
    height of lines (not glyphs)

block-level

display
  block
  inline
  inline-block
  grid
  flex

p vs div vs span

why cm uses divs instead of spans?
  try with block display and spans
    without block displays, changing stuff to spans breaks it irreversibly


"focused" class

how flexbox works

selection and cursor layers
content div holds lines
no textarea element


I'd like a textarea
  or maybe a div
no wrapping
  that makes gutters a bit easier
capturing buffer mutating events
gutters and stuff 

textarea events
  input-event (copy, cut, paste)
  select

overriding default behavior
  preventDefault
    on textarea it prevented input keys, but not browser shortcuts

tabbing out

is default textarea behavior handled by event listeners?
  no, it prolly works with JS disabled

disabling selection
  user-select: none
  doesn't work for textareas

listener properties vs. other listeners

what's aria?
  accessability stuff

view
window & document

does monitorEvents also monitor children?

do unimplemented events fire?

mousedown in child overrides click events
do children override parents?
  child's events fire first

for mouse events, the target is always the deepest element


$0
  last selected element in devtools
